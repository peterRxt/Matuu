                    <h2>Peter and Vincencia</h2>
                    <h3>First Edition</h3>

                    <h4>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h4>
                    <p>It was December 2023, a time of great loss and deep despair. Floods had ravaged Garissa, leaving me with nothing—only the will to begin again. At Hallmark Supermarket, I met Vincencia Masea,.</p>
                    <p>We exchanged contacts. I learned she lived in Matuu. I needed clothes, and I trusted her enough to send her some cash. She returned to Garissa with not just the clothes I asked for—but an extra pair she paid for herself. That simple gesture touched me. I saw care. I saw kindness. I saw someone different. 🥰</p>
                    <p>We met at Killas Lodge. That night, I returned home with a heart full of curiosity about this woman who had stepped into my storm with warmth. ❤️‍🔥</p>
                    <p>When she was in Garissa again, I would visit her at Killas Lodge. Days passed, and my interest grew deeper.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 2: Growing Closer</h4>
                    <p>In March 2024, my grandmother (Cucu) passed away. It was a painful time. To my surprise, Vincencia came for the funeral. Her presence, her support—it meant everything. It showed me how much she cared. 🥹</p>
                    <p>After the burial, she invited me to visit her home in Matuu town. That's when I met her daughter, Gabriella Amor—beautiful, bright, in Grade 2 at Parochial School. Just like her mother, I loved her instantly. 👨‍👩‍👧</p>
                    <p>Three days later, I returned to Garissa. Our conversations deepened. Later that same March, she came back to Garissa—not to a lodge this time, but to my home. That marked the end of Killas Lodge in our story. 🏡</p>
                    <p>We started discussing staying together. But how could we? One of us had to make a sacrifice.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 3: A New Home in Matuu</h4>
                    <p>She had a business—Vimax Kuku Shop—and also worked at Kenchic. I worked at Hallmark Supermarket. In August 2024, I made my decision. I left Garissa, left my job, and joined her in Matuu. I began working at the Vimax Kuku Shop. From that point, we were husband and wife in everything but name. 👫</p>
                    <p>But with time came challenges. 😔</p>
                    <p>My struggles: <strong>mental health</strong>, <strong>depression</strong>, and <strong>diet-related diseases</strong>.<br>Her struggles: <strong>back pain</strong>, <strong>leg pain</strong>, <strong>stomach cyst</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Then came the worst—the loss of an unborn child. 💔</p>
                    <p>We began to feel more and more distant. 😞</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 4: Challenges and Separation</h4>
                    <p>I began to feel disrespected. There were long daily calls with the BO guy. I didn't feel loved. My health declined, and I barely ate well. 😠</p>
                    <p>She, too, felt unloved—I didn't talk to her often. She felt I was irresponsible, especially for not finishing medications. She accused me of cheating—with female customers at Vimax, Shiku in Garissa, a KCB girl, Musakulu in Bungoma. She said I was rude, inattentive. 😤</p>
                    <p>By May 2025, the tension had become unbearable. One morning, she called Anko Gitau from Nakuru for a talk. The following day, she asked for separation. She believed things would never improve. 😭</p>
                    <p>And that's how our story ended. 😔</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 5: Memories Worth Keeping</h4>
                    <p>Despite the challenges, our time together had unforgettable moments: ✨</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sister Triza came to help Vincencia at the Vimax Kuku Shop and stayed for about five months. She had her fair share of complaints and at times caused tension, but she was part of our journey.</li>
                        <li>When I moved to Matuu, she surprised me with a welcome-home birthday celebration. It made me feel seen and valued. 🥳</li>
                        <li>Clara's birthday on December 25, 2024, was full of joy. Her laughter made that Christmas extra special. 🎄</li>
                        <li>We attended Njeri's wedding on December 12, 2024, and danced like a happy couple. It felt like old times. 💃🕺</li>
                        <li>In September 2024, I was admitted to Kenyatta Hospital due to chest caving. I felt weak, but she stood by me through it. 🤒</li>
                        <li>She also suffered health issues, and I took her to Parochial Health Centre when her pain became unbearable. 🏥</li>
                        <li>Jacob at Kenchic. I never liked him. 😒</li>
                        <li>There was also the BO guy—always calling, always present, making me feel like I wasn't enough. 📞</li>
                        <li>Aunties Vero</li>
                    
                    <p>In March 2024, I asked auntie Veroif it was okay to marry from the Kisii tribe. She said, "It's okay, go ahead." That answer guided my decision to build a life with her. 🙏</p>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I called her <strong>KAMUMMY</strong> she called me <strong>BABE</strong>, anko called her <strong>mama Vince</strong> dad called her <strong>Nyanduko</strong>!!</p>
                    <p class="the-end">THE END!!</p>
